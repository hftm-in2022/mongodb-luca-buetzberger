### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Project Insight
Using MongoDB Atlas was similar to working with other databases, but I noticed some differences. For example, relationships are created by referencing ObjectIds instead of directly linking objects like in relational databases. It took a bit of time to get used to how ObjectId works differently from strings in queries, but overall, it was easy to work with and felt familiar.
